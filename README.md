HiraKana
========

Please view my demo at this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fzKJeT8-9g

This is one of the main classes that runs the HiraKana android application. In total, there are roughly ~175 images, 7 layout XML files, and 6 Java class files that make up this app. For ease of investigating I have only uploaded this one file, which controls the logic for the Hiragana game mode. 

A few notes:
-I created this app for use on my Nexus 5, and I'm still currently trying to fix the code so it works optimally on all Android devices
-Android GUI layouts are written in XML
-Each button had to be created individually, and contain a unique method in the Java file (which is why you'll find a lot of repetition for the buttonClick methods)
